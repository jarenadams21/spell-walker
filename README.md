## Todo
  1. Inventory / Backpack transactions
    
      FIRST: Code Organization, 
      SECOND: FIX SpellPack Hashmap and Spell struct to store names in Spells and map Spells to i32 values, 
      THEN: Fix the code that does not work
    
        [ X ] Insertions
        [ ] Deletions
        [ ] Updates/increasing count  
        [ ] Conveniency functionality (getters,setters,etc.)
        [ ] Finish Craft a Spell view
        [ ] Finish Monster Park (with some help from liberation::main...)
  
  2. Combine metrics, view eqiupment, etc. into one "view yourself"
